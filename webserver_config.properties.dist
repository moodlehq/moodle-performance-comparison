## Repository and test branches information ##################

# The moodle repository where the base branch is located.
repository="https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git"

# The base where both before and after branches will be updated.
# This is necessary in case there are changes in
# the generators codebase between before and after, we would not
# be able to compare results as the test plan generator or the
# generated data would change, so this setting will always be
# pointing to a minor or major release hash.
#
# You don't need to change this value
